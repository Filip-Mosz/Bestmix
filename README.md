# Bestmix
my copy of Anet's website - polish Bestmix Distributor 
done for training and as warmup before (and after) last practical project for SDA bootcamp

I try do make it easy to change content: 1st try is with JSON, the 2nd will be with SQL (probably H2)
I also want to do quite easy internationalization
EDIT: properties for each language proved to be the easiest, and most convenient way to fill content

It in some way turned out to be rather Thymeleaf training than Java :|
