# Bestmix
my copy of Anet's website - polish Bestmix Distributor
done for training and as warmup before (and after) last practical project for SDA bootcamp

I tried to make it easy to change content, so it's provided by JSON
internationalization done by MvcConfig provided by Spring
frontend done with Thymeleaf + bit of Bootstrap

It in some way turned out to be rather Thymeleaf training than Java :|

#### after some time owner of original website contacted me with a proposal to make a new version of it, so from now on the rest of my work is private :)
EDIT 16,05,2021: Some glimpses of code added, so I can present how is website working (but, sadly I'm unable do show working process)
##### I hope in short time results may be seen here: http://bestmix.pl/
###Stack:
Java + Spring Boot,
HTML + CSS + Thymeleaf,
Bootstrap
