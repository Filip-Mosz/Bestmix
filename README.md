# Bestmix
my copy of Anet's website - polish Bestmix Distributor 
done for training and as warmup before (and after) last practical project for SDA bootcamp

I try do make it easy to change content: 1st try is with JSON, the 2nd will be with SQL (probably H2)
I also want to do quite easy internationalization
EDIT: properties for each language proved to be the easiest, and most convenient way to fill content

It in some way turned out to be rather Thymeleaf training than Java :|

#### after some time owner of original website contacted me with a proposal to make a new version of it, so from now on the rest of my work is private :)
##### I hope in short time results may be seen here: http://bestmix.pl/
